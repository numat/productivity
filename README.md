Productivity
============

##### NOTE: This is in very early stages of development.

Installation

```
pip install productivity
```

Usage
=====

### PLC Configuration

This driver uses Modbus TCP/IP for communication. Unlike the ClickPLC, modbus
addresses need to be manually configured in the Productivity PLC firmware (see
[manual](https://cdn.automationdirect.com/static/manuals/p2userm/p2userm.pdf)).

To use this driver, go to `Write Program → Tag Database`, scroll down to the values
you care about, and double click the `Mod Start` cell of each value to assign an address.
Then, go to `File → Export → Tags` to export a csv file. The file is used here so
you don't need to remember the addresses.

### Command Line

To print the tags and their values, simply call the library with the PLC IP address and the tags file.
```
$ productivity the-plc-ip-address path/to/tags.csv
```

Use --set to set values on the PLC:
```
$ productivity the-plc-ip-address path/to/tags.csv -s "{int_test: 4, float_test: 4.45, string_test: foo}"
```
The --set parameter takes [YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/), a simple data format that allows you to easily set multiple tags at once.

See `productivity --help` for more.

### Python

This driver uses Python ≥3.5's async/await syntax to asynchronously communicate with
a Productivity2000 PLC. For example (note that asyncio.run() requires Python >=3.7):

```python
import asyncio
from productivity import ProductivityPLC

async def run():
    async with ProductivityPLC('the-plc-ip-address', 'path/to/tags.csv') as plc:
        print(await plc.get())

asyncio.run(run())
```

It is also possible to set tag values:
```python
async def run():
    async with ProductivityPLC('the-plc-ip-address', 'path/to/tags.csv') as plc:
        await plc.set(start=True, setpoint=1.1)

asyncio.run(run())
```
